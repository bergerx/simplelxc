* Solve these "grep TODO *"
* Add help messages for each script, just hitting enter without parameters must show what to do
* Add log for each action taken
* Add error hadlers, trapping ERR and INT is needed, each script must clean its waste if there is some
* Make this package run on ubuntu 11.10
* what if openssh-server not installed, then we cant put host key into the guests because there is no host key yet
* in some cases, ssh server in the guest system starts later, so that user could run "ssh enter" before ssh-server started, we should guide users to wait instead of doing nothing
* More explanation in README:
** When listing simplxc guest we use conventions, hat are they
** users can use "sl" instead of "simplelxc" e.g. "sudo sl list"
** we should say that we are using minbase when creating new templates
